# Natural Language Processing

## Introduction 

  Natural Language Processing (NLP) combines linguistics and artificial intelligence in order to allow Computers to understand human language. NLP is used daily, such as Language translations, predictive texts, and Smart assistants (such as Siri and Alexa). I explore a few of the many usages of NLP. 

## Project 1 - Detecting Entity Types

  In this project, my code uses a NLP pipeline in order to detect the entity type from "keywords". An entity code categorizes nouns in each sentence. For example, in the sentence, "Robert Downey Jr. is awesome!", the program categorizes Robert Downey Jr. as a person. Thus, an example output looks like this:

```
Robert Downey Jr. (PER)
```

Note that (PER) is an entity type, which identifies a person.
